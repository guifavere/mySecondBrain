# The World of Software Design and Architecture

1. The goals of software are to:
	1. Goal #1: Satisfy the users' needs while minimizing the effort it takes to do so.
	2. Goal #2: Consistently accomplish Goal #1 as the requirements change.
2. Architecture is about identifying the system quality attributes that will stack our odds of successfully performing Goal #1, and our choice of architectural pattern that will best accommodate the project.
3. Software design isn't much different from architecture besides the fact that they have different levels of design that they appear at.
