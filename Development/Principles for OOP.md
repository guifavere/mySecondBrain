# Principles for OOP

1. Don't use getters, setters and static methods, they break encapsulation.
2. Dont' use inheritance, prefer composition.
3. Objects can talk to each other via messaging. Calling a method of an object to get some service from it.
4. Objects must be immutable.
5. Objects must be like black boxes, hiding their behavior and data from other objects.
6. Every object should provide a limited set of services according to its responsibility.
7. Every object should depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.
