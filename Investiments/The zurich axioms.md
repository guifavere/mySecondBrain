# The zurich axioms

The book: **The Zurich axioms** was written in 1985 by Max Gunther, and it brings the rules of risk and reward used by generations of swiss bankers.

Below are the rules, just a bit summary:
1. If you are not worried, you are not risking enough. Always play for meaningful stakes but don't bet amounts whose loss would bankrupt you.
2. Always take your profit too soon: short modest winning streaks are the most common. Decide in advance what you want, then get out when get it.
3. Take small losses to protect yourself against big ones. When the ship starts to sink, jump.
4. Beware of forecasts of human behavior.
5. Chaos is not dangerous until it begins to look orderly. Past success is no guarantee of future performance.
6. Beware of getting too comfortable. Keep your eyes open to better opportunities at all times.
7. Your intuition can be trusted if it can be explained. Don't confuse a hunch with a hope.
8. No such thing as a sure thing. It's a mistake to sell your offering as a sure thing and a bigger mistake to buy into a "sure thing".
9. Never make a move if you are merely optimistic. Know how you will handle the worst.
10. The majority is probably wrong: think things through on your own. The best time to buy is often when nobody else wants it.
11. Be persevering but not stubborn. Focus on learning what works, not proving your first insight correct.
12. Be cautious about long range plans. Planning is useful, but you must adjust as you go.
